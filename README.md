This paper reports on the use of cellulose paper simultaneously as electrolyte, separation of
electrodes, and physical support of a rechargeable battery. The deposition on both faces of a
paper sheet of metal or metal oxides thin layers with different electrochemical potentials,
respectively as anode and cathode, such as Cu and Al, lead to an output voltage of 0.70 V and
a current density that varies between 150 nA/cm and 0.5 mA/cm, subject to the paper
composition, thickness and the degree of OH_ species adsorbed in the paper matrix. The
electrical output of the paper battery is independent of the electrodes thickness but strongly
depends on the atmospheric relative humidity (RH), with a current density enhancement by
more than 3 orders of magnitude when RH changes from 60% to 85%. Besides flexibility, low
cost, low material consumption, environmentally friendly, the power output of paper batteries
can be adapted to the desired voltageâ€“current needed, by proper integration. A 3-V prototype
was fabricated to control the ON/OFF state of a paper transistor.
